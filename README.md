I'm an embedded systems engineer by degree, but a software engineer by heart. I love building things—from clean UIs to robust backends—and I'm always curious about what’s under the hood.

### 🔧 What I Do

I build full-stack apps, design systems, and enjoy working across the stack—whether it's wiring up APIs, shipping frontend features, or automating workflows.
